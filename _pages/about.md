Welcome to my webpage ! I am a postdoctoral researcher within the <a href="https://seiscope2.osug.fr/?lang=en" target="_blank">Seiscope</a> consortium at Université Grenoble Alpes, working on uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inference for full waveform inversion. 
Before that I worked as a research engineer at Siemens Digital Industries Software, where I developed numerical methods for the <a href="https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/fluids-thermal-simulation/star-ccm/" target="_blank">Simcenter STAR-CCM+</a> simulation software. 
I have a general interest in applied mathematics and scientific computing, with a focus on applications.

I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at Université de Lorraine and Université de Liège in 2022. I worked on domain decomposition methods and non-reflecting boundary conditions for time-harmonic flow acoustics problems, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://iecl.univ-lorraine.fr/membre-iecl/antoine-xavier/" target="_blank">Xavier Antoine</a> and Prof. <a href="https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/" target="_blank">Christophe Geuzaine</a>. 
I hold an engineer degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics, which helps me approach problems with both mathematical and physical perspectives.

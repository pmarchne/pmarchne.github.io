I am a research engineer at Siemens Digital Industries Software working on the development of numerical methods for simulation software. 
I have a general interest in applied mathematics and scientific computing, with a focus on applications.

I obtained my PhD at Université de Lorraine and Université de Liège in 2022, where I worked on domain decomposition methods and non-reflecting boundary conditions for time-harmonic flow acoustics problems. 
I hold a degree in Mechanical engineering and a Master of Science in applied mathematics, which gives me different perspectives of a problem.
